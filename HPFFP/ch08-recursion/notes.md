# Chapter 08 - Recursion

* **Defining a function in terms of itself.**

* Recursion is **a natural property of many logical and mathematical systems**,
like human language.

* It is also a means of expressing code that must take an **indefinite** number of steps to return a result.

* Recursive expressions need to have **a base case** in order to stop
* Recursion is also **self-referential compisition**.
* Haskell implemented recursion with **Y Combinator**.
